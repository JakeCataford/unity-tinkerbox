Jake's Unity Tinkerbox
===============

About
----

This is a collection of drop in scripts that can come in handy for game development. The directory structure is `{CATEGORY}/{COMPONENT_NAME}/` for each isolated set of scripts. With an `Editor` folder nested inside that contains any nescescary editor scripts for the component to work.

Each script is also namespaced under the `Tinkerbox` namespace to keep conflicting names to a minimum in existing projects.

Dependencies are outlined in the comment header of each script.

Contributing
----

Please, Fork this repository, then submit a pull request for changes. It would be awesome if you could categorize your branches under `feature/` `bugfix/` `refactor/` or `chore/` before you submit. Also, keep commits small and clean and pull requests topical and consice. (as per the open source norm)

Please open issues if you see problems that you don't want to fix just yet. And we can discuss them via the comments.

Thanks!
-Jake
